Start at the outside and push the slices right to the edge; after going all round the edge, fill in the centre with straight pieces of salmon.\nMash the cream cheese until smooth (a rubber spatula is good for this), working in the mignonette pepper and a pinch of salt at the same time. Pour in two-thirds of the cream, a little at a time, and keep stirring and beating until a smooth, lightly whipped cream consistency is achieved. Now work in the lemon juice. If slightly too firm (it should be spreadable), work in the remaining cream and then recheck for seasoning.\nDollop about a quarter of the cream cheese in the centre of the salmon and spread to the edge with the spatula or a palette knife; slowly turn the tin to get an even thickness of about 3mm. Top this with a salmon layer, continuing until both salmon and cheese have been used, finishing with a salmon layer. Press the top down with your hands. Stretch cling film over and refrigerate for at least four hours \u2013 or preferably overnight.\nMake the dressing. Simmer the shallots, sugar and brandy in a small pan until almost dry and a deep brown colour \u2013 about 5 minutes. Tip into a bowl and leave to cool. Whisk the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche in a bowl with the mustard and lime juice, and whisk in the cold shallots.Whisk in the olive oil, trickling it slowly as if making mayonnaise. Season, cover the bowl with cling film and chill in the fridge for 2 hours or overnight.\nTo turn the salmon gateau out, dip a knife into a jug of warm water and run it carefully around the inside of the tin, between the gateau and the sides, to release the salmon from the tin. Invert a flat serving plate or board on top, then turn the gateau out upside down and lift off the tin and the cling-filmed base. You will now be left with a perfectly flat top to the salmon-layered gateau.\nThe gateau is best cut into wedges while set firm, then left to reach room temperature for 20-30 minutes before serving \u2013 it will soften slightly and have more flavour being less cold. Just before serving, chop the dill and whisk it into the dressing, which is best served straight from the fridge.

Then, to remove the skin, you\u2019ll need a very sharp knife, preferably a filleting knife. Take each fillet in turn and place skin -side down on the board with the narrowest end facing you. Slide your knife in between the skin and the flesh from the tail end, and wiggle your knife to loosen and pull away the skin. Firmly take hold of the tail skin you have loosened and, working away from yourself, cut along the length of the fish, while moving the knife side to side. Keep the blade of your knife as flat and close to the skin as possible so as not to leave any flesh on the skin. Repeat with the second fillet.\nHeat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Take a very large sheet of extra-wide foil (turkey foil works well), and lightly brush with olive oil. Place one salmon fillet on the foil and scatter over the sliced lemons, dill and half the fennel, and season generously. Place the second salmon fillet on top, domed side up. Season and drizzle with the wine.\nTop with a second sheet of greased foil and fold up the edges to enclose the salmon in a parcel. Make the parcel quite loose so there is room for the steam. Lift onto a large baking tray and cook for 1 hr then remove and allow to rest in the foil for 10 mins.\nWhile the salmon cooks, make the mayonnaise. Place the yolks and the mustard in a medium bowl, adding a pinch of salt, if you like. Pour the oil into a jug as you will need a controlled steady stream. Briefly whisk the eggs and start to drizzle on the oil very slowly, starting with a few drips at a time while continuously whisking.\nContinue adding the oil. When the mayonnaise starts to come together, you can add the oil slightly quicker. Continue until all the oil has been added. If the mayonnaise curdles at any point, you can rescue it by cracking another yolk into a clean bowl and whisking the curdled mayonnaise into the fresh egg. Continue doing this then add any remaining oil.\nWhen your mayonnaise is made, slowly stir in the vinegar and enough of the lemon juice to your taste \u2013 add more if you like it quite lemony. Season with salt and pepper, and stir in the chopped herbs. Keep chilled until the salmon is ready.\nMix the cucumber with some of the dill and the rest of the fennel. When the salmon has rested, cut the foil open and use two fish slices to carefully transfer the fish to a long serving platter. Sprinkle with the dill and garnish with lemon cheeks. Serve with the herby mayonnaise and cucumber salad."},

Once you start to smell the rich aromas of the spices, you know they have cooked through. If they start to smoke, the spices will taste bitter and it would be better to start again. Once toasted, roughly crush using a pestle and mortar, or wrap the spices in a tea towel and crush with the base of a small saucepan. Stir in a pinch of black pepper.\nScrape the skin sides of the salmon with a knife to get rid of any remaining scales, and scrape off as much of the film of moisture you sometimes get (this helps to get the skin crisp). Slash the skin 3 times, about 3cm in length, to stop it shrinking during cooking.\nTip the spice mix onto a plate, lay the fish on it, skin-side up, so that the spices cover the underside of the fish. You can do this a few hrs ahead to help infuse the fish with the spices. You can also start the sauce ahead \u2013 put the finely chopped shallots in a pan with the vinegar, fish stock and saffron. Bring to the boil, then reduce by two-thirds. Set aside.\nPut the potatoes in a pan and cover with salted water. Bring to the boil and boil for 1-2 mins only, then drain. Heat the oil in a large frying pan, then add the turmeric and chilli powder, if using. Toss the potatoes in the spiced oil, then cook for 5 mins without stirring. Shake the pan and cook for 5-10 mins more, or until the potatoes are cooked through. Season and keep warm.\nWhen ready to cook the salmon, rub the skin sides with some oil, then fry in a pan (skin-sides down) on a medium heat with a little bit more oil, pressing down lightly on the fish for a few secs when it first goes in the pan. Don\u2019t touch the fish or move the pan for about 5-6 mins \u2013 this ensures you get beautiful crisp skin. When the edges start to look golden, turn the fish over and cook for 1 more min.\nWhile the fish is cooking, cook the spinach in a large pan of boiling water for 2 mins. Drain, then squeeze out the excess water. Return to the pan and stir in the butter. This will form a simple emulsion, which will prevent water running out over the plate. Season.\nTo finish the sauce, warm the pan of reduced mixture until hot. Take off the heat, then whisk in all the butter, reserving 2-3 cubes. Once the butter is amalgamated, stir in remaining cubes. Season with pepper and use immediately.\nPlace a spoonful of spinach in the middle of each plate, then lay the salmon on top. Scatter some potatoes and pour some sauce around the fish.
